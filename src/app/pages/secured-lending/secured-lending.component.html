      <p>By definition a secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or
        property) as collateral for the loan, which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor who
        gives the loan. If the borrower defaults on the loan then the lender can seize the property to recoup
        some of their loss.</p>
      <p>At Natrium EFCU we have two options for secured lending the traditional Secured Loan as defined
        above plus we offer Share Secured Loans.</p>
      <p>With a Share Secured Loan the borrower can use existing funds that they may have to secure a loan
        at a lower interest rate. Share Secured Loans are a great way to borrow small amounts and build
        your credit. These loan also traditionally carry a much lower interest rate !
        Please refer to our rates page to check current rates for the different types of loans we offer.
        In each case it is best to stop by or call the Credit Union to discuss your options and find the best
        solutions for your situation.</p>
