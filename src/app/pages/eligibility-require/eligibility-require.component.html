      <h4 class="secondary">Member Identification Disclosure</h4>
      <p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires
        all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an
        account. All persons are subject to the identity verification requirements even though they may be a long-term
        member of and well known to the institution.</p>
      <p>What this means for you: When you open an account, Bayer Heritage FCU will request documentary verification of
        your identity, such as a driverâ€™s license or passport and/or it will verify your identity through other
        documentary methods.</p>
